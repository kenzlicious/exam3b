<h3> Previous Work </h3> 


	 <a href = "./HW3/"> Simple Salary Calculator </a> <p> 
	 This was a homework assignment using 2 jsp pages. One was the index, which takes in tax information and rate info, and then calculates income. It was difficult to get the paths correct between the index
	and results page, but you can enter data into the index. </p> 
	
	<a href = "./devicesApp/"> Interactive Device Database</a> <p> 
	We were tasked with creating a database of our own. I took devices within my apartment and labelled them by owner, model, and brand. The functionality requests were being able to create, read, update, and delete items in the database. 
	I found the easiest part was always the "read" function. On this app, you can read and delete, but I was unable to get update and add working correctly. Update couldn't find the correct class in the servlet so I had to take some files out before deploying this file. My add
	function was very close, but the new device is not being posted back into the read in the end. </p>
